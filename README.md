_While working on this project an imporvement I would make in the future would be to make a side bar that had a fixed postion so while the user was anywhere on the page they could navigate to the different sections. I would also add a fixed button in the bottom right corner that said **Book a table** so the user so it would be more compelling for site visitors to want to nativigate to the reservation section._
